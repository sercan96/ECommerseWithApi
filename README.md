# Product Listing System by Category with Simple MVC API and Web Interface

The system I developed was created using the C# programming language and ASP.NET Core framework, based on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The system uses MSSQL Server database as infrastructure. The API (Application Programming Interface) system provides access to clients via the HTTP protocol and works in line with RESTful principles.

On the API side, there is an endpoint that lists products by categories. This endpoint receives the request from the client, makes the necessary database queries and returns the results to the client in JSON format. This way, clients can retrieve products by category with a simple HTTP request.

Separate controller, service and repository classes provided by MVC were used in the data access and business logic layers. This structure ensures that the code is modular and easy to maintain. By using Entity Framework Core for database operations, database connections and queries are performed safely and effectively.

On the client side, a simple and user-friendly web interface has been designed. The interface was created and communication with the API was established using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Users can view products by category and select the products they want via the web interface.

This system is professionally developed, reliable, scalable and easy to maintain. It is coded in accordance with best practice principles on both the API side and the client side.
